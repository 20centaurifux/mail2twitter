without sharing the password.

Requirements
------------

You require Python 2 to execute the script. You will need also the
following packages:

* pyicu
* tweepy


Usage
-----

Before using mail2twitter please open the 'config.py' file to configure
the application.

mail2twitter stores information in a database file. To specify the
location of this file set a valid path ('DB_PATH').

Also enter your POP3 and SMTP credentials to let mail2twitter receive
and send messages.

Now login to Twitter to create a consumer key and secret. mail2twitter
needs these values to connect to Twitter ('CONSUMER_KEY',
'CONSUMER_SECRET').

mail2twitter can handle emails in HTML format by using the Lynx browser
for rendering. Therefore please set the (full) path to your Lynx browser
('LYNX_EXECUTABLE').

When you have finished the configuration you can create the first user:

# mail2twitter.py --create-user [username] [firstname] [lastname] [email]

There are two options available to query user information:

# mail2twitter.py --show-users
# mail2twitter.py --show-user [username]

If you want to enable/disable an account use the option
'--enable-user [username]' or '--disable-user [username]'.

Kindly note that mail2twitter will only process emails from enabled users.

To create a tweet please send an email with the subject 'tweet' to the
specified email address. The body of your message will be tweeted.

It's also possible to follow/unfollow users. Therefore send and email
with the subject 'follow'/'unfollow'. The message body can be a comma-separated
list of Twitter user names or a single name.

Use the option '--fetch-mails' to receive emails. Received commands are
stored in an internal queue. You can print this queue with the following
command:

# mail2twitter.py --show-queue

To process the queue use the '--post' option.

When mail2twitter receives mails or connects to Twitter it will generate
various messages (e.g. when a received email is invalid). It's possible to
send these messages with the '--send-messages' option. mail2twitter will
use the defined SMTP credentials to send mails.

You can print a list with all available commands by entering

# mail2twitter.py --help


Have fun!
